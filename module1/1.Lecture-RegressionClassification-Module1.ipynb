tables of data. \n","\n","![](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/figures/05.02-samples-features.png)\n","\n","The features matrix is often stored in a variable named `X`. The features matrix is assumed to be two-dimensional, with shape `[n_samples, n_features]`, and is most often contained in a NumPy array or a Pandas `DataFrame`.\n","\n","We also generally work with a label or target array, which by convention we will usually call `y`. The target array is usually one dimensional, with length `n_samples`, and is generally contained in a NumPy array or Pandas `Series`.

Choose a class of model by importing the appropriate estimator class from Scikit-Learn.\n","2. Choose model hyperparameters by instantiating this class with desired values.\n","3. Arrange data into a features matrix and target vector following the discussion above.\n","4. Fit the model to your data by calling the `fit()` method of the model instance.\n","5.
